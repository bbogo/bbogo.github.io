   <strong>Personal software</strong>
   
   <p> Below you can find a few algorithms I developed myself. I work mainly in 
   Matlab and FreeFem, so the codes will be related to these two programming
   languages. If you find some of the codes below useful and you use them in your research, please
   give credit by citing a related publication. If you have suggestions or improvements concerning any of these
   I'd be happy to discuss them with you.</p>

   <strong>Computation of the Steklov/Wentzell Spectrum using FreeFem</strong>

   <p>The following program computes the first few eigenvalues of the Steklov/Wentzell operator for a two
   dimensional shape. The current shape is quite particular, but it can be changed by using
    any of the methods available in FreeFem for defining boundaries. This code was used in 
    <a href="pdfs/fsol_article.pdf">my article</a>
    concerning the computation of the Wentzell spectrum with fundamental solutions in order
    to compare my results to the ones obtained with a mesh-based method. You can download the FreeFem program 
    here: <a href="software/wentzel_test.edp">wentzel_test.edp</a>
    (right click, Save as).</p>

    <strong> The Steklov/Wentzell Spectrum using fundamental solutions in Matlab</strong>
    
    <p>The following algorithm uses fundamental solutions in order to solve certain spectral problems.
    The method was inspired by Alves and Antunes and it is presented in detail in 
    <a href="pdfs/fsol_article.pdf">this publication</a>. You can get the program here: 
    <a href="software/wentzell_test.m">wentzell_test.m</a> (right click, Save as) You could
    check out the huge speed difference between this fundamental solution formulation and 
    the FreeFem code.

    <strong> Dirichlet eigenvalue optimization in 2D with FreeFem </strong>
    
    <p> <table><tr><td width = 80%> The following algorithm is an example of eigenvalue shape optimization problem under area constraint in two dimensions.
    It uses finite element computations in FreeFem. This type of numerical computations were initially performed by E. Oudet
    and recently by P. Antunes and P. Freitas. I revisited them using Mpspack in my <a href="pdfs/PHD_thesis.pdf">phd thesis</a>. 
    The following program works rather well for the first 10 eigenvalues. Sometimes different initial conditions
    should be used to get close to the minimizer. You can get the program here:

    <strong> Maximization of the fundamental eigenvalue in domains with holes - FreeFem code</strong>
    
    <p> <table><tr><td width = 80%> We want to find the position of some circular holes in a two dimensional domain
    which maximize the first Dirichlet Laplace eigenvalue. More details about the problem and the results 
    you can obtain using the algorithm can be found <a href="max_dirichlhet_holes.html">here</a>.

    <strong> Numerical study of Polya's conjecture with FreeFem </strong>
    
    <p> <table><tr><td width = 80%> The following script starts from a polygon and evolves using the gradient flow
    given by the derivative of the first Dirichlet eigenvalue under area constraint. We can see that the algorithm
    converges towards a regular polygon, which is to be expected, since Polya's conjecture suggests that
    regular polygons minimize the first Dirichlet Laplace eigenvalue under area constraint.
    More details about the problem and the algorithm can be found <a href="faber_krahn_polygons.html">here</a>.

   <strong>Useful computing software</strong>   
   
   <p>Here are some Matlab toolboxes I use a 
   lot:
  <ul><li><a href="http://www.cs.toronto.edu/~liam/software.shtml">LBFGS</a> 
  by Liam Stewart: a nice implementation
  of the LBFGS optimization algorithm. It allows
  bounds on every variable and the use of
  callback functions.</li>
  <li><a href="http://www.cs.ubc.ca/~schmidtm/Software/minFunc.html">minFunc</a> by Mark Schmidt.   
  Minfunc allows the use of many types of
  optimization algorithms like steepest descent
  lbfgs, etc.</li> 
  <li><a href="http://www.cs.nyu.edu/overton/software/hanso/">HANSO</a>: BGFS 
  optimization implementation.  </li> 
  <li> <a href="https://code.google.com/p/mpspack/">MpsPack</a>. A Matlab 
  toolbox which solves all sorts of problems from PDE to eigenvalue problems. It
  uses methods based on particular solutions. It is rather fast and very precise.</ul>   
   </p>
   
   <p> Although I'm not a specialist, I find <a href="http://www.freefem.org/ff++/">FreeFem++</a> to be really useful
   in the study of PDEs. It has all you need to get you started, and all the
   dirty work regarding meshes is done automatically once you give it the right
   commands. For beginners, like me, there's a really nice visual editor for 
   FreeFem++, which makes the installation and use of FreeFem programs very
   easy. You can find it here: <a href="http://www.ann.jussieu.fr/~lehyaric/ffcs/index.htm">freefem++cs</a>
