      <p><strong>Spectral optimal partitions on surfaces</strong></p>       
         
     <p>You can consult a set of results for other surfaces by clicking <a href="manifolds_spectral.html">here</a>.</p>         
         
     <p style="text-align: left;"> Here are some preliminary numerical results for a problem of optimal partitioning
     on the sphere. We consider the problem 
      $$ \min \sum_{i=1}^n \lambda_1^{LB}(S_i)$$
      where $(S_i)$ is a partition of the sphere into $n$ parts. The same problem was studied recently by Elliott 
      and Ranner (<a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/1408.2355">link</a>), using a different numerical method. </p>
     
     <p style="text-align: left;"> The computations made below were made using a method based on fundamental solutions 
     (inspired from the one mentioned <a href="steklov_numeric.html">here</a>). The numerical optimization is made in two steps:
     <ul>First, a fictious domain method is used, in order to detect the structure of the partition (inspired from
     the 2D computations made by Bourdin, Bucur, Oudet - 
     <a href="http://www-ljk.imag.fr/membres/Edouard.Oudet/research/Eigs_honeycomb/html/index_n.html">link</a>)</ul>
     <ul>Secondly, the structure is extracted, and the optimization is continued, using a mesh adapted to each set of the partition</ul>
     
     Both of the above steps are based on the same method of fundamental solutions.
     </p>
     
     <p style="text-align: left;"> We present below the numerical results we obtained for $3 \leq n \leq 17$ and $n=32$ parts (the goal is 
     to make the computations for all $k \in [3,32]$. Our 
     results coincide with those of Elliott and Ranner, which made computations for
     $n \in \{3,4,5,6,7,8,16,32\}$. The case $n=12$ was not considered in their article, but our result (the 
     pentagonal tiling) seems to be the expected optimal partition. 
     </p>
     
     <p>
     We note the striking resemblance (at least topologically) 
     between our results and the
     one obtained by Cox and Flikkema (<a href="http://www.combinatorics.org/ojs/index.html/eljc/article/view/v17i1r45">link</a>)     
     in the case of equi-areal partitions which minimize the
     total perimeter. This similarity was also seen in the 2D
     computations. As seen 
     <a href="http://www-ljk.imag.fr/membres/Edouard.Oudet/research/Eigs_honeycomb/html/index_n.html">here</a>, 
     asymptotically, the optimal 2D
     spectral partition consists 
     (numerically) of a tiling of regular hexagons. This 
     was proved by <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/math/9906042">
     T. Hales</a> in the case of the plane equi-areal
     partitions which minimize the total perimeter.     
     </p>
     
     <p>The computations presented below were made using Matlab, and the 
     visualization was made in Matlab
      using a code based on the package
     <a href="http://www.mathworks.com/matlabcentral/fileexchange/24484-geom3d">geom3d</a>.
     The results obtained using a density method are represented on a triangulation of the
     sphere, using a nearest point interpolation; this is the reason that the boundaries are
     a bit blurry.  </p>
