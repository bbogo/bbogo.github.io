      <p><strong>Partition which minimize the largest fundamental eigenvalue</strong></p>   
      
      <p>In collaboration with Virginie Bonnaillie-Noel.</p>
      
      <p>We consider partitions of a two dimensional domain $D$ which minimize the functional
      $$ F((\omega_i))= \max_i \lambda_1(\omega_i)$$
      where $\lambda_1(\omega)$ is the first eigenvalue of the Dirichlet-Laplace operator on $\omega$. Apart from 
      some cases where we know that the optimal partition is associated to a nodal function, there is not much 
      information we know about the structure of the optimal partition. We are thus motivated to perform
      some numerical simulations in order to find candidates for these minimal partitions. The numerical 
      algorithm we use is inspired from the paper of Bourdin, Bucur and Oudet. I have other computations
      made using this algorithm in the case of the sum of the eigenvalues: check <a href="polygonal_spectral.html">this link</a>. 
      The main idea is that instead of computing the eigenvalue of the shape $\omega$ we consider a function $\varphi$ which 
      approximates the characteristic function $\chi_\omega$ and we solve the problem
      $$  -\Delta u +C(1-\varphi)u = \lambda u \text{ in }D$$
      where $D$ is the bounding box or the computation domain and $C\gg 1$ is a penalization constant.
      </p>
      
      <p>We know that the maximum of a family of regular functions is not necessarely smooth and thus
      trying to minimize the maximum directly does not lead to conclusive results. We take another approach 
      suggested in a paper of Bonnaillie-Noel and Lena which is to minimize a $p$-norm for large $p$:
      $$    \left( \frac{\lambda_1(\omega_1)^p+...+\lambda_1(\omega_n)^p}{n}\right)^{1/p}.$$</p>
      
      <p>Numerically we can go as high as $p=50$. What we expect is that the optimal candidate we obtain is
      an equipartition (i.e. the first eigenvalue of every cell is the same). Our candidates are almost
      equipartitions. In some cases, the results obtained with the relaxed formulation allow us to conjecture
      that the optimal  partition has a certain particular configuration or some kind of symmetry. With these
      assumptions we are able to improve the relaxed results.</p>
      
      <p>The numerical study of the partitions goes as follows: 
      <ul>
      <li>First we perform the numerical optimization with the relaxed formulation for $p \in \{1,2,3,...,50\}$.</li>
      <li>Then we extract the contours, by using, for example, Matlab's contour function.</li>
      <li>For each contour we construct a mesh and we compute the first eigenvalue using finite elements.</li></ul></p>
      
      <p>Below you can see some results. We have noted the following observations during our simulations:
      <ul><li>
      If we want to obtain good results with the penalized formulations we need to have a penalization constant
      $C$ as large as possible.</li>
      <li>In order to acheive this it is useful to consider the improvement of the algorithm of Bourdin, Bucur and Oudet
      using only points of the finite difference grid which are close to the cell whose eigenvalue we compute. More details
      can be seen <a href="large_spectralpart.html">here</a>.</li></ul></p>
